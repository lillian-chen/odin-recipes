    <p>The lasagna is a delectable dish of layers. One layer of self-doubt, followed by a layer of guilt. Then a layer of worthlessness topped with a spread of hopelessness. Another layer of self-doubt, this time baked to crispy self-loathing perfection and topped off with melted anxiety. The dish comes together, each component complementing one another, culminating in the ultimate culinary experience of the human condition.</p>
